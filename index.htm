      <h3>What People are Saying About VASL:</h3>
      <p><i>&quot;VASL is a perfect example of how the Internet is continuing to bring about a gaming Renaissance.&quot;</i></span><br><span class="quoteSource">Vox Day, Syndicated Technology Columnist</span></p>
      <p><span class="quote"><i>&quot;A remarkable achievement!&quot;</i><br/><span class="quoteSource">Bruce Geryk, Games Domain </p>
      <p><i>&quot;The greatest thing since the invention of SL itself!&quot;</i></p>
      <p><i>&quot;When I recently discovered VASL, I immediately purchased the ASL rulebook and modules 1-4.&quot;</i></p>
      <p><i>&quot;VASL has 'saved' a lot of people that might have given up on ASL.&quot;</i></p>
      <p><i>&quot;Made me run out and buy the ASL rules again...&quot;</i></p>
      <p><i>&quot;With the potential of playing over the net, I've picked up CDG and AP1 in just the last few months.&quot;</i></p>
      <p><i>&quot;VASL has drawn me back with as much enthusiasm as I had when I was a 16 year old.&quot;</i></p>
      <p><i>&quot;Fills the void of not having face-to-face players handy...&quot;</i></p>
      <p><i>&quot;Has tripled my ASL play...&quot;</i></p>
      <p><i>&quot;My play of VASL resulted in me purchasing 6 modules that I probably never would have purchased due to lack of opponents. &quot;</i></p>

            <h1 align="right">ASL Over the Internet!</h1>

      	    <p>VASL is that adaptation of the <a href="http://www.vassalengine.org/">VASSAL engine</a> to the ASL game system.</p>

            <p>Those who know <a href="http://www.multimanpublishing.com/" target="_blank">Advanced Squad Leader</a> (or ASL)
            know it as the finest tactical wargame of all time. One of the best selling military boardgames ever, ASL depicts
            WWII combat at the level of individual squads, guns, vehicles, and machine-guns with a degree of detail never
            achieved in another game. Those who enter the world of ASL often find that its complexity means that opponents are
            difficult to find, particularly for people who don't live in major population centers. This is where VASL comes in.</p>

            <p>VASL is a computerized interface for playing ASL over the Internet. It does not replace the need to own the
            boardgame, but it does allow any two players to connect and play each other live over the Internet. Unlike games
            played over Internet chat sites (IRQ's), you are able to <b>see and manipulate</b> both the maps and counters on the
            VASL screen and transmit this information instantaneously to your opponent. Play by email or connect to the online
            server, where you can view other games being played, share information, chat, and compete in online tournaments.
            It's a club for those without a club, and it's changing the hobby. </p>
